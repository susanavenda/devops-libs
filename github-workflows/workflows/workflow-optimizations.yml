# Workflow Optimization Best Practices
# This file documents optimizations applied to all workflows

# 1. Security Optimizations
# - Pin actions to SHAs (not tags) to prevent supply-chain attacks
# - Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication
# - Limit workflow token permissions (least privilege)
# - Use dependency-review-action for PR security checks

# 2. Performance Optimizations
# - Set job timeouts (30 minutes default)
# - Use caching for dependencies (npm, maven, pip, etc.)
# - Parallelize independent jobs
# - Use concurrency controls to prevent redundant runs
# - Optimize artifact retention (7 days default)

# 3. Cost Optimizations
# - Use self-hosted runners for high-volume projects
# - Cancel redundant workflow runs
# - Use matrix builds efficiently
# - Cache Docker layers
# - Optimize Terraform state operations

# 4. Reliability Optimizations
# - Add retry logic for flaky operations
# - Use continue-on-error strategically
# - Add health checks before deployment
# - Implement rollback strategies
